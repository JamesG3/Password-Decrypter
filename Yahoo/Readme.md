YahooFilter.py		—— Extract the password part out from the original file.
YahooPsw.txt		—— The output file of YahooFilter.

RockyouEnhanced1.0.py	—— compare rockyou.txt and YahooPsw.txt to find new passwords
newPas.txt		—— The passwords included in YahooPsw.txt but not in the original rockyou.txt



## I used almost the same code to pick out the new passwords from uniqpass, then add them into rockyou.txt, renamed as RockyouEnhanced2.0.txt
